# Chapter Four

Yin enjoyed sitting in the car, daydreaming while watching the scenery outside the window, sketching the city's outline in his mind and imagining some far-fetched scenarios. The city had changed a lot in five years. The billboards hanging on the skyscrapers now featured female stars he didn't recognize, and many places had been renovated to look even more splendid. "Maybe, I really shouldn't have left this place," Yin mused half-jokingly as scenes flashed by the window, waiting for home to slowly draw nearer. The not-so-long drive still took several hours, and by the time Yin got home, it was almost dawn.

"Looks like they've changed the lock." Yin tried to use his key to open the door, but it wouldn't fit. With no other choice, he had to stand at the front door and call his family. It was Yin's mom who answered the phone, "Hello, who is this?" came the impatient voice from the phone, making Yin feel very apologetic. When his mom heard Yin's voice, her tone immediately changed, becoming very excited. The door opened, and both his parents appeared in front of Yin, faces beaming with excitement. Yin, feeling a bit embarrassed for waking them up so early, smiled at the doorway, "I'm back, mom and dad." Seeing their son, whom they hadn't seen much of for years, the parents were obviously too happy to sleep. After a brief chat with Yin, they told him to go get some rest first. Yin watched them go about their business before he walked into his bedroom. Instantly, he was enveloped by the smell of home, a feeling he hadn't experienced in a long time.

By the time Yin woke up, it was nearly noon. He wandered around the house, taking in all the changes that had occurred over the past five years. "Mom still loves to make drastic changes to this poor house," Yin thought amusingly as he looked at his old room, which had been completely transformed. Suddenly, it seemed he remembered something; he squatted by the bed, rummaging underneath it. Soon, he dragged out a rather large wooden box. "Can't believe this thing wasn't thrown away!" The box was locked, and clearly, Yin didn't have the key anymore. However, it didn't take much effort for him to pry the small lock open. The box was filled with all sorts of things: peculiar seashells, cute hairpins, letters received during high school, yellowed photo booth pictures… Yin rummaged through the items in the box while talking to himself, "Turns out, I used to be quite the sentimental girl! What a weirdo, haha." The past is in the past. Yin closed the box, shoved it back under the bed, and walked out of the room. Sometimes, memories of the past can be beautiful to think about, but there are also those that one has to say goodbye to.

Upon entering the kitchen, Yin's parents were preparing lunch. It was a perfect opportunity for Yin to join in and show off his skills. During his five years in the United States, Yin had cooked for himself and had even taken the time to learn how to cook at a local Chinese restaurant because of his initially poor culinary skills. Yin's mother watched her son's focused figure as he cooked and realized that her child had truly grown up. "The once video-game-obsessed mope has now become a fine man; perhaps I really should thank Xiao Ye," the mother thought as she sat watching her son's back. "After lunch, go see Xiao Ye," she suggested. Hearing this, Yin paused, then replied indifferently, "It's not really convenient now; she must be busy. We'll naturally see each other when the time comes." Yin's mother seemed to want to say more, but she ultimately held back.

Having not eaten with his family for a long time, Yin was exceptionally excited, happy like a child. He spoke freely with his parents about everything that had happened over the past five years, as if he hadn't had such an unburdened conversation in ages. Yin's parents looked at their son now and felt a deep compassion for the loneliness he must have faced alone in a foreign place. They knew better than anyone how introverted and fragile their son used to be. People do change, but the personality traits formed in childhood always remain somewhere deep in the soul.

After eating, Yin decided to go out for a walk to experience the changes his hometown had undergone in the last five years. Perhaps he was hoping for a chance encounter with someone, even though he tried not to entertain such thoughts logically. Five years can change a lot; the bookstore he once loved had long since closed down, the internet cafe where he used to spend every weekend playing video games had turned into a bustling supermarket, and the small town had mysteriously sprouted many tall buildings… The plethora of changes made Yin feel uncomfortable, as if the memories of the past were nothing but illusions.

In fact, there wasn't really anywhere particularly suited for leisurely strolls in the small town. So, Yin once again found himself habitually stepping into his high school. Of course, he detested it there during his high school years, because he wasn't able to attend the same school as Xiao Ye. He would always unconsciously fantasize that if they could have studied together, perhaps everything would have been different. Unfortunately, all the 'what ifs' in the world don't lead to outcomes. After graduating, however, he always ended up spending his surplus holiday time here with his friends. Here, although he missed experiencing high school with Xiao Ye, he still made many friends who became very important in his life later on. It was here he understood that different living environments can lead to completely different lives, but these lives are not to be compared as better or worse.

"Huh! They still haven't taken down this dangerous thing?" Yin remarked upon seeing the dilapidated swing near the sports field. He remembered that five years ago, just before leaving the country, he had gazed upon a beautiful full moon from the highest point of this very swing.

Moonlight bathed Xiao Ye, who was sitting on the swing, gently swaying back and forth. Yin leaned against a pillar next to her, kicking at the stones on the ground with his foot, head bowed, silent. He wanted to say something but didn't know where to start, feeling conflicted. All the while, the summer cicadas played their solitary concert.

"When have you decided to leave?" Xiao Ye was the first to speak, which came as a slight surprise to Yin.

"Next month, I guess. You're going to miss me, aren't you?"

"Is that so? Then let me give you a gift as a keepsake. What would you like?"

Xiao Ye paid no attention to Yin's boring joke, merely speaking as she had anticipated.

"a gift, huh? Then, a ring," Yin also switched to a more neutral tone.

"Alright, I'll go take a look around. I'll give it to you before you leave."

After concluding this exchange, both parties lapsed back into silence.

After a long thought, Yin finally mustered up the courage.

"Hey, Xiao Ye, can you wait for me? I will definitely come back. When I do, will you marry me?"

He kept adjusting the tone in which he delivered these words, trying to find a balance between jest and earnestness. But in the end, he couldn't quite turn it into a deeply moving farewell.

"You think it's so easy to marry me? Just go find yourself a pretty foreign girl and be good."

Xiao Ye didn't say anything more and walked away alone. Yin did not chase after her, watching her retreating figure as if she was walking into the moon. He sat down on the swing, tightly grasping the chains on both sides. He really disliked his current self, appearing weak and powerless. Suddenly, he forcefully kicked off the ground, making the swing fly. He wanted to get closer to the warm moon, wanting to shake off the tears on his face.

Time eventually halted the swinging of the swing, dried the tears at the corner of the eyes, and pushed the story forward without looking back.

Yin sat on the swing, lost in his memories for a long time, and when he came back to his senses, he realized it was time to go home. Slowly leaving the swing, he moved forward in accordance with the progression of the story. He knew too well that dwelling too much on the past wasn't a good thing. Yet even he, who considered himself more mature now, couldn't resist the onslaught of sadness at certain moments. He always felt that there was a gap deep within his heart that still needed to be filled.
