# Chapter Two
Due to last night's heavy snowfall, the entire city was draped in a silver coat, with the thick blanket of snow absorbing the bustle of the bustling metropolis. Yin lazily sat in the car heading to the airport, gazing at the swiftly receding scenery outside the window, aimlessly reminiscing about the times he once sped from the opposite direction.

"I'm here! America." Yin kissed the ring hanging on his chest, pushed open the heavy doors of the airport with dreams in tow, and officially set foot on the land of New York.

Arriving in this unfamiliar city for the first time, Yin was very excited; everything was new to him. He walked out of the airport and took a funny pose for a photo with the airport sign.

The car was carrying Yin towards a future he couldn't possibly foresee. In that moment, he silently repeated in his mind, "I will come back, Ye. I will reappear before you in a whole new way."

"If the passing time could also return to its original place like this reversing scenery, what kind of life would I choose again?" Yin watched the advertisements flashing back and forth outside the window, pondering a question that didn't hold much meaning. He knew that he couldn't find an answer to this foolish question, but he couldn't help but think about it anyway. As long as there are choices and gains and losses, one will think about the "what ifs." Yin habitually reached with his right hand, which was propping up his head, across his chest, feeling for something that wasn't there. He looked down, gave an awkward smile.

It was like a videotape being rewound, with different scenes flashing quickly before his eyes until everything returned to the starting point.

After a two-hour car journey, Yin finally arrived at his destination. Stepping out of the car, he stretched his arms and loosened his muscles. The massive airport sign came into view once again. Yin took out his phone, posed as if to take a photo of the sign, but didn't press the shutter button. "Huh, when did I start reminiscing about the past? Could it be that I've really gotten old? No way, I'm still a young literary guy," he thought, still in the pose of taking a photo, his mind a jumble of thoughts.

"Yo! Uncle Sam, I'm heading home now." Yin said with a smile as he walked through the heavy glass doors, feeling calmer than the excitement he had five years ago. Every unfamiliar city brings a sense of novelty and loneliness. But no matter which city you live in, life is always about the simplest necessities: firewood, rice, oil, and salt. Once the glitz is stripped away, Yin learned to love his life in a more serene way.

The roar of the plane carried Yin towards his hometown.

Yin realized he had brought the wrong book onto the plane, and its abstract content made him fall asleep after reading just a few pages, slumped against the seat. The book fell to the side of the seat, with the title page reading:

The things we've lost may not be retrieved, but the memories we've forgotten can be recalled. Cherish the memories.

——Ye
