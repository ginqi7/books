# Chapter Three

Time seemed to have slipped away unnoticed, and by the time Yin awoke, it was probably already dark. He wasn't fully alert and stared blankly at the seat in front of him, trying to piece together the scattered fragments of the dream he had just had.

In the dream, fleeting images of Yin's experiences over the past five years flashed by. There were scenes of him running till he vomited to build stamina for baseball; a romantic relationship that ended before he could even understand its beginning and end; and every time he felt down, he would run to the rooftop of his apartment to feel the breeze… It was these fragmented images that wove together the tapestry of Yin's growth over these five years. These years abroad were as simple and growth-inducing as any other period in Yin's life, yet Yin always felt as if something during these five years was stuck, unable to move smoothly.

After spacing out for a while, Yin's brain, not yet fully escaped from the clutches of sleep, began to slowly clear up. He slid open the window shade next to him and gazed out at the night sky, not knowing over which part of the world he was, uncertain of what to do next. "It would be nice if I could just sleep until we arrive," he thought. However, now that he was awake, there was no chance of falling asleep again. He looked around for something to pass the time. The dull book had been placed by his side by the flight attendant. Even though he was not particularly interested in reading it again, he had nothing else to do, so he decided to let the book continue to "cleanse" his soul.

The plane landed smoothly on the long-missed land. Yin gathered his belongings and disembarked. The warm central air conditioning inside the plane made him forget that it was winter. As soon as he stepped off the plane, the cold air made him shiver uncontrollably. Yin opened his suitcase and took out the coat he had stuffed in before boarding the plane. Accidentally, a grey-silver hand-knitted scarf fell out. He paused for a moment, but the cold air urged him to move quickly. Thus, Yin swiftly put on his coat, wrapped the scarf around his neck, and hopped onto the airport shuttle bus.

Yin said goodbye to the giant bird that had brought him back to his homeland, then disappeared from the bird's view.

The sky was filled with fireworks, dazzling and spectacular. The sounds of the fireworks and firecrackers were so lively that one had to intentionally raise their voice a few decibels to be heard clearly. On a festive winter night, Yin and Xiao Ye strolled down the streets of the small town, engaging in sporadic casual conversation.

"Hey, Xiao Ye, do you know how to knit scarves?"

"I am quite ladylike, you know. Of course, I can do such a simple task~!"

"Awesome, then knit me a scarf. I'll definitely devote myself to you in return."

"As long as you don't devote yourself to me, I'll give you one!"

"……"

Actually, Yin never wore scarves at this time; he felt uncomfortable having something wrapped around his neck. Moreover, with the heart of a young man, he seldom felt cold. He simply wished to receive a gift filled with warmth and affection, just like the protagonists in TV shows.

The distant bell rang twelve times, marking the arrival of another new year. Yin walked on the left side, looking at Xiao Ye's profile, chatting about trivial topics. He hoped that this path would never end, that they could always walk shoulder to shoulder, gazing at that warm smiling face.

Ste out of the airport and seeing faces that looked just like his own, Yin was a bit surprised, but this feeling quickly turned into the warmth of returning home. "I really am back, Xiao Ye," Yin whispered to himself, smiling brightly. Yin's home was in a small town in the suburbs, so he hailed a car by the roadside, letting it carry him and his full heart of longing towards the place where he grew up.
